The original workflow used to deploy software environments to the spacetelescope science platform
involved an iteration between 3 tighter workflow loops:

1. Notebook and envirionment definition and local testing

In this loop a notebook repo curator or class instructor chooses the notebooks they wish
this environment to support, installs a corresponding Python environment,

2. Platform ehancement and Docker image building and local testing

3. Image deployment to JupyterHub for use by users
