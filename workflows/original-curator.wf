Based on the following text, please generate a diagram expressed in
Mermaid format.  Don't feel like its necessary to include every detail
expressed in the text,  but try to capture the complexity of the
overall data flow in terms of repositories and actors.  Please
include 2 clearly delimited sections of output:  the Mermaid formatted
diagram you generate from my inputs below, and a second section in
which I encourage you to rewrite my natural language request in a
manner which is most effective for your use.   While I may not adopt
your version,  feel free to make any corrections or simplifications
which occur to you as improvements.  Interspersed with or following
your revisions,  giving your rationale for making them will also be
very helpful when I write future descriptions.

Please diagram the following text in Mermaid format:

The curator works on their laptop trying to determine the exact Python
package versions needed to run a set of notebooks which are found in 
notebook repositories on github.  The curator defines the notebooks and
top level properties of their target Python environment in a YAML
specification.  Based on this information, the nb-curator tool
downloads the specified notebooks and their associated
requirements.txt files. The nb-curator tool then uses micromamba to
interact with conda-forge and uv to interact with pypi to download
Python packages and create an environment taylored to the specified
notebooks and the union of their requirements.txt files.  The tool
scrapes explicit imports from each notebook and ensures they all
import successfully in the target environment; this is a fast basic
check.  Subsequently the curator tool runs each notebook in the target
environment using papermill to determine if it executes to completion
without crashing; this is a more time consuming and more thorough check
which still has a lot of room for improvement. With the exception of
testing, at each phase, the nb-curator tool adds the products of its
computations to an output section of the YAML spec.

When all tests are passing successfully, the curator uses the
nb-curator tool to trigger a Docker image build on the
science-platform-images GitHub repo which incorporates the specified
target environment.  The method by which the spec is communicated and
the build is triggered is TBD.  Upon completion of the Docker build
the Docker image is transferred to AWS ECR from where it can be
downloaded and used by science platform JupyterHubs such as the Roman
Research Nexus or TIKE.  The nature of this transfer mechansim and any
AWS credentials required is also TBD.  The two key properties of this
latter phase of the process are that (a) it must be entirely
autonomous and (b)
