To create "untrusted wranglers" with PR capability:
    Add CODEOWNERS file protecting everything except /nbw-spec-archive/
    Only CODEOWNER or CODEOWNER-PAT can approve
    Add wranglers as collaborators but not CODEOWNERS
        Wranglers can use nb-wrangler to push specs for validation + build only
    Wranglers install gh using apt-get or brew
    Wranglers authenticate using "gh auth login" as independent command
    Alternately, wranglers set GH_TOKEN to a GitHub token
    nb-wrangler uses "gh" internally to interface with GitHub

Branch protections on main are a requirement, no pushes w/o review
    Administrator accounts are exempted from (unprotected by) branch restrictions
    "Test wrangler" account cannot be admin who provides PAT since even admins cannot review themselves

pull_request_target action required to merge PR from action
    PAT for administrator required to push submission to main
    PAT for administrator required to approve+merge PR
    nb-wrangler uses "gh" internally to create the PR
    workflow uses "gh" explicitly to approve and merge the PR
